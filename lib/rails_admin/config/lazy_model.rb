        # When evaluating multiple configuration blocks, the order of
        # execution is important. As one would expect (in my opinion),
        # options defined within a resource should take precedence over
        # more general options defined in an initializer. This way,
        # general settings for a number of resources could be specified
        # in the initializer, while models could override these settings
        # later, if required.
        #
        # CAVEAT: It cannot be guaranteed that blocks defined in an initializer
        # will be loaded (and adde to @deferred_blocks) first. For instance, if
        # the initializer references a model class before defining
        # a RailsAdmin configuration block, the configuration from the
        # resource will get added to @deferred_blocks first:
        #
        #     # app/models/some_model.rb
        #     class SomeModel
        #       rails_admin do
        #         :
        #       end
        #     end
        #
        #     # config/initializers/rails_admin.rb
        #     model = 'SomeModel'.constantize # blocks from SomeModel get loaded
        #     model.config model do           # blocks from initializer gets loaded
        #       :
        #     end
        #
        # Thus, sort all blocks to excute for a resource by Proc.source_path,
        # to guarantee that blocks from 'config/initializers' evaluate before
        # blocks defined within a model class.

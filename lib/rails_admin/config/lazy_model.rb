          # When evaluating multiple configuration blocks, the order of
          # execution is important. As one would expect (in my opinion),
          # options defined within a resource should take precedence over
          # more general options defined in an initializer. This way,
          # general settings for a number of resources could be specified
          # in the initializer, while models could override these settings
          # later, if required.
          #
          # CAVEAT: It cannot be guaranteed that blocks defined in an initializer
          # will be loaded (and adde to @deferred_blocks) first. For instance, if 
          # the initializer references a model class before defining
          # a RailsAdmin configuration block, the configuration from the
          # resource will get added to @deferred_blocks first:
          #
          #     # app/models/some_model.rb
          #     class SomeModel
          #       rails_admin do
          #         :
          #       end
          #     end
          #
          #     # config/initializers/rails_admin.rb
          #     model = 'SomeModel'.constantize # blocks from SomeModel get loaded
          #     model.config model do           # blocks from initializer gets loaded
          #       :
          #     end
          #
          # Thus, sort all blocks to excute for a resource by Proc.source_path,
          # to guarantee that blocks from 'config/initializers' evaluate before
          # blocks defined within a model class.
          @deferred_blocks.flatten.sort_by{|p| p.source_location.first =~ /config\/initializers/ ? 0 : 1}.each do |block|
            @model.instance_eval(&block)
          end

It started as a port of [MerbAdmin][merb-admin] to Rails 3 and was implemented
as a [Ruby Summer of Code project][rubysoc] by [Bogdan Gaza][hurrycane] with
mentors [Erik Michaels-Ober][sferik], [Yehuda Katz][wycats], [Luke van der
Hoeven][plukevdh], and [Rein Henrichs][reinh].

## Announcements

* for those with `rake db:migrate` errors, update to master and check that you see the line: "[RailsAdmin] RailsAdmin initialization disabled by default." when you launch the task. If not (or if migrations still don't work), open a ticket with an application on Github that can reproduce the issue.

* `config.models do ... end` is deprecated (note the 's' to models, `config.model(MyModel) do .. end` is fine), for performance reasons (forces early loading of all application's models). Duplicate to each model instead, before next release. If you really need the old behavior:
 
```ruby
config.models.each do |m|
  config.model m do
    # <<<< here goes your code
  end
end
```

## Features

* Display database tables
* Create new data
* Easily update data
* Safely delete data
* Custom actions
* Automatic form validation
* Search and filtering
* Export data to CSV/JSON/XML
* Authentication (via [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise))
* Authorization (via [Cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan))
* User action history (internally or via [PaperTrail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail))
* Supported ORMs
  * ActiveRecord
  * Mongoid [new]

## Demo

Take RailsAdmin for a [test drive][demo] with sample data. ([Source code.][dummy_app])

[demo]: http://rails-admin-tb.herokuapp.com/
[dummy_app]: https://github.com/bbenezech/dummy_app

## Installation

In your `Gemfile`, add the following dependencies:

    gem 'fastercsv' # Only required on Ruby 1.8 and below
    gem 'rails_admin'

Run:

    $ bundle install

And then run:

    $ rails g rails_admin:install

This generator will install RailsAdmin and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) if you
don't already have it installed. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is strongly
recommended to protect your data from anonymous users. Note: If you do not already have [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) 
installed, make sure you remove the registerable module from the generated user model.  


It will modify your `config/routes.rb`, adding:

```ruby
mount RailsAdmin::Engine => '/admin', :as => 'rails_admin' # Feel free to change '/admin' to any namespace you need.
```

Note: Your RailsAdmin namespace cannot match your Devise model name, or you will get an infinite redirect error.
The following will generate infinite redirects.

```ruby
mount RailsAdmin::Engine => '/admin', :as => 'rails_admin'
devise_for :admins
```

Consider renaming your RailsAdmin namespace:

```ruby
mount RailsAdmin::Engine => '/rails_admin', :as => 'rails_admin'
devise_for :admins
```

See [#715](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/715) for more details.

It will also add an intializer that will help you getting started. (head for config/initializers/rails_admin.rb)


Finally run:

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate

Optionally, you may wish to set up [Cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan),
[PaperTrail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail), [CKeditor](https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor), [CodeMirror](https://github.com/fixlr/codemirror-rails)

More on that in the [Wiki](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki)

## Usage

Start the server:

    $ rails server

You should now be able to administer your site at
[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

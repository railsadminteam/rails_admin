It started as a port of [MerbAdmin][merb-admin] to Rails 3 and was implemented
as a [Ruby Summer of Code project][rubysoc] by [Bogdan Gaza][hurrycane] with
mentors [Erik Michaels-Ober][sferik], [Yehuda Katz][wycats], [Luke van der
Hoeven][plukevdh], and [Rein Henrichs][reinh].

## Demo

Take RailsAdmin for a [test drive][demo] with sample data. ([Source code.][dummy_app])

[demo]: http://rails-admin-tb.herokuapp.com/
[dummy_app]: https://github.com/bbenezech/dummy_app

## Installation
In your `Gemfile`, add the following dependencies:

    gem 'fastercsv' # Only required on Ruby 1.8 and below
    gem 'rails_admin'

Run:

    $ bundle install

And then run:

    $ rails g rails_admin:install

This generator will install RailsAdmin and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) if you
don't already have it installed. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is strongly
recommended to protect your data from anonymous users.
It will modify your `config/routes.rb`, adding:

```ruby
mount RailsAdmin::Engine => '/admin', :as => 'rails_admin' # Feel free to change '/admin' to any namespace you need.
```

It will also add an intializer that will help you getting started. (head for config/initializers/rails_admin.rb)

Finally run:

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate

Optionally, you may wish to set up [Cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan),
[PaperTrail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail), [CKeditor](https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor)

More on that in the [Wiki](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki)

## Usage
Start the server:

    $ rails server

You should now be able to administer your site at
[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

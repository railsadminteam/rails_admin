-# FIXME: the asset pipeline combined javascript (without jquery included) loads before the google CDN jquery,
-# so we end up with a jQuery undefined error. For now, I added jquery to the asset pipeline, but it's not ideal
-# as it might load jQuery twice (if the main application or another engine already loads it). Also remember to
-# add that back to the tests in spec/requests/rails_admin_spec.rb as well.

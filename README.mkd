RailsAdmin
==========
RailsAdmin is a Rails engine that provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your data.

RailsAdmin started as a port of [MerbAdmin](http://github.com/sferik/merb-admin) to Rails 3
and was implemented as a [Ruby Summer of Code project](http://www.rubysoc.org/projects)
by [Bogdan Gaza](http://github.com/hurrycane) with mentors [Erik Michaels-Ober](http://github.com/sferik),
[Yehuda Katz](http://github.com/wycats),
[Luke van der Hoeven](http://github.com/plukevdh), and [Rein Henrichs](http://github.com/reinh).

It currently offers the following features:

* Display database tables
* Create new data
* Easily update data
* Safely delete data
* Automatic form validation
* Search
* Authentication (via [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise))
* User action history

Supported ORMs:

* ActiveRecord

_[Information](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/105) about support for other ORMs._

Help
----
If you have a question, you can ask the [official RailsAdmin mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rails_admin)
or ping sferik on IRC in [#railsadmin on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=railsadmin).

API Update Note
---------------
The ability to set model labels for each section (list, navigation, update, ...) has been removed,
as it was deemed unnecessarily granular and was not fully honored in all displays.
That also means that the methods `label_for_navigation`, etc. are no longer functional. They print a warning at the moment.
See details in the examples below for the currently supported way to label models.
This change was motivated by the conversation following a [bug report](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/319/#issue/319/comment/875868)
about label display errors.

The ability to set model visibility for each section has been removed due to
same reasons as section specific label configuration (see above paragraph).
This also means that methods such as `hide_from_navigation` and `show_in_list`
are no longer functional and have been deprecated. For now on use model level
configuration of visibility or for more granular control integrate an
authorization framework as outlined later in this document.

Installation
------------
In your `Gemfile`, add the following dependency:
    gem 'devise' # Devise must be required before RailsAdmin
    gem 'rails_admin', :git => 'git://github.com/sferik/rails_admin.git'
Run:
    $ bundle install
And then run:
    $ rails generate rails_admin:install_admin
This task will install RailsAdmin and [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) if you
don't already have it installed. [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is strongly
recommended to protect your data from anonymous users.

If you plan to use Devise, but want to use a custom model for authentication
(default is User) you can provide that as an argument for the installer. For example
to override the default with a Member model run:
    $ rails generate rails_admin:install_admin member

If you want to use the CKEditor, you need to [download it](http://ckeditor.com/download) from source
and unpack the 'ckeditor' folder into your default 'public/javascripts' folder. If you're using any
non-Windows system, you can try to use the automatic downloader:
    $ rake admin:ckeditor_download

When running RailsAdmin in production the images, stylesheets, and javascript assets may return 404
not found error's depending on your servers static assets configuration.  To prevent this issue you
can copy assets directly into your application by running:
    $ rake admin:copy_assets
        
Usage
-----
Start the server:
    $ rails server
You should now be able to administer your site at <http://localhost:3000/admin>

Configuration
-------------
RailsAdmin provides its out of the box administrative interface by inspecting your application's
models and following some Rails conventions. For a more tailored experience, it also provides a
configuration DSL which allows you to customize many aspects of the interface.

The configuration code should be placed in an initializer file, for example:
    config/initializers/rails_admin.rb


### General

You can customize authentication by providing a custom block for `RailsAdmin.authenticate_with`.
To disable authentication, pass an empty block:

    RailsAdmin.authenticate_with {}

You can exclude models from RailsAdmin by appending those models to `excluded_models`:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.excluded_models << ClassName
    end


### Model Class and Instance Labels ###

**Setting the model's label**

If you need to customize the label of the model, use:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        label "List of teams"
      end
    end

This label will be used anywhere the model name is shown, e.g. on the navigation tabs,
Dashboard page, list pages, etc.

**The object_label method**

The model configuration has another option `object_label` which configures
the title display of a single database record, i.e. an instance of a model.

By default it tries to call "name" or "title" methods on the record in question. If the object responds to neither,
then the label will be constructed from the model's classname appended with its
database identifier. You can add label methods (or replace the default [:name, :title]) with:

    RailsAdmin.config {|c| c.label_methods << :description}

This `object_label` value is used in a number of places in RailsAdmin--for instance as the
output of belongs to associations in the listing views of related models, as
the option labels of the relational fields' input widgets in the edit views of
related models and as part of the audit information stored in the history
records--so keep in mind that this configuration option has widespread
effects.

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        object_label do
          "#{bindings[:object].name} - #{bindings[:object].league.name}"
        end
      end
    end

This would output "Team's name - Team's league's name" in all the places
mentioned in paragraph above example.

*Difference between `label` and `object_label`*

`label` and `object_label` are both model configuration options. `label` is used
whenever Rails Admin refers to a model class, while `object_label` is used whenever
Rails Admin refers to an instance of a model class (representing a single database record).


### Navigation ###

* hiding a model
* setting the model's label
* configuring the number of visible tabs

**Hiding a model**

You can hide a model from the top navigation by marking its `visible` option
as false:

By passing the value as an argument:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        visible false
      end
    end

Or by passing a block that will be lazy evaluated each time the option is read:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        visible { false }
      end
    end

These two examples also work as a generic example of how most of the
configuration options function within RailsAdmin. You can pass a value as an
argument `option_name value`, or you can pass in a block which will be
evaluated each time the option is read. Notable is that boolean options' reader
accessors will be appended with ? whereas the writers will not be. That is, if
you want to get the Team model's visibility, you use
`RailsAdmin.config(Team).visible?`.

**Configuring the number of visible tabs**

You can configure the number of tabs visible in the top navigation:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.navigation.max_visible_tabs 3
    end

Links to the rest of the models will be rendered in a drop down menu next to the
tabs. Even though this option is not model specific, it shares the same
semantics as the earlier ones - you could also pass in a block which would be
evaluated at runtime.


### List view ###

* Number of items per page
* Number of items per page per model
* Default sorting
  * Configure globally
  * Configure per model
* Fields
  * Visibility and ordering
  * Label
  * Output formatting
  * Sortability
  * Column CSS class
  * Column width

**Number of items per page**

You can configure the default number of rows rendered per page:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.list.default_items_per_page = 50
    end

**Number of items per page per model**

You can also configure it per model:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          items_per_page 100
        end
      end
    end

**Default sorting**

By default, rows sorted by the field `id` in reverse order

You can change default behavior with use two options: `sort_by` and `sort_reverse`

**Default sorting - Configure globally**

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.models do
        list do
          sort_by :updated_at
          sort_reverse true
        end
      end
    end

**Default sorting - Configure per model**

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Player do
        list do
          sort_by :name
          sort_reverse { false }
        end
      end
    end

**Fields - Visibility and ordering**

By default all fields are visible, but they are not presented in any particular
order. If you specifically declare fields, only defined fields will be visible
and they will be presented in the order defined:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name
          field :created_at
        end
      end
    end

This would show only "name" and "created at" columns in the list view.

If you need to hide fields based on some logic on runtime (for instance
authorization to view field) you can pass a block for the `visible` option
(including its `hide` and `show` accessors):

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name
          field :created_at
          field :revenue do
            visible do
              current_user.roles.include?(:accounting) # metacode
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

Note that above example's authorization conditional is not runnable code, just
an imaginary example. You need to provide RailsAdmin with your own
authorization scheme for which you can find a guide at the end of this file.

**Fields - Label**

The header of a list view column can be changed with the familiar label method:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name do
            label "Title"
          end
          field :created_at do
            label "Created on"
          end
        end
      end
    end

As in the previous example this would show only columns for fields "name" and
"created at" and their headers would have been renamed to "Title" and
"Created on".

**Fields - Output formatting**

The field's output can be modified:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name do
            formatted_value do
              value.to_s.upcase
            end
          end
          field :created_at
        end
      end
    end

This would render all the teams' names uppercased.

The field declarations also have access to a bindings hash which contains the
current record instance in key :object and the view instance in key :view.
Via :object we can access other columns' values and via :view we can access our
application's view helpers:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name do
            formatted_value do
              bindings[:view].tag(:img, { :src => bindings[:object].logo_url }) << value
            end
          end
          field :created_at
        end
      end
    end

This would output the name column prepended with team's logo using the `tag`
view helper. This example uses `value` method to access the name field's value,
but that could be written more verbosely as `bindings[:object].name`.

Fields of different date types (date, datetime, time, timestamp) have two extra
options to set the time formatting:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name
          field :created_at do
            date_format :short
          end
          field :updated_at do
            strftime_format "%Y-%m-%d"
          end
        end
      end
    end

This would render all the teams' "created at" dates in the short format of your
application's locale and "updated at" dates in format YYYY-MM-DD. If both
options are defined for a single field, `strftime_format` has precedence over
`date_format` option. For more information about localizing Rails see
[Rails Internationalization API](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#adding-date-time-formats)
and [Rails I18n repository](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale).

**Fields - Sortability**

You can make a column non-sortable by setting the sortable option to false:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name
          field :created_at do
            sortable false
          end
        end
      end
    end

**Fields - Column CSS class**

By default each column has a CSS class set according to field's data type. You
can customize this by:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name
          field :created_at do
            css_class "customClass"
          end
        end
      end
    end

This would render the "created at" field's header and body columns with a CSS class named
"customClass".

**Fields - Column width**

By default columns' widths are calculated from certain pre-defined,
data-type-specific pixel values. If you want to ensure a minimum width for a
column, you can:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        list do
          field :name do
            column_width 200
          end
          field :created_at
        end
      end
    end

### Create and update views

* Field groupings
  * Visibility
  * Labels
  * Syntax
* Fields
  * Rendering
  * Overriding field type
  * Available field types
  * Creating a custom field type
  * Creating a custom field factory
  * Overriding field help texts
  * CKEditor integration

**Field groupings**

By default RailsAdmin groups fields in the edit views (create and update views)
by including all database columns and belongs to associations to "Basic info"
group which is displayed on top of form. Below that are displayed all the other
associations a model has, one group per association.

The configuration accessors are `edit`, `create` and `update`. First one is a
batch accessor which configures both create and update views. For consistency,
these examples only include the batch accessor `edit`, but if you need differing
create and update views just replace `edit` with `create` or `update`.

**Field groupings - visibility**

Field groups can be hidden:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          group :default do
            hide
          end
        end
      end
    end

This would hide the "Basic info" group which is accessed by the symbol :default.
Associations' groups can be accessed by the name of the association, such as
:fans or :players. The hide method is just a shortcut for the actual `visible`
option which was mentioned in the beginning of the navigation section.

**Field groupings - labels**

Field groups can be renamed:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          group :default do
            label "Team information"
          end
        end
      end
    end

This would render "Team information" instead of "Basic info" as the groups label.

**Field groupings - syntax**

As in the list view, the edit views' configuration blocks can directly
contain field configurations, but in edit views those configurations can
also be nested within group configurations. Below examples result an
equal configuration:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          group :default do
            label "Default group"
          end
          field :name do
            label "Title"
            group :default
          end
        end
      end
    end

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          group :default do
            label "Default group"
            field :name do
              label "Title"
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

In fact the first examples `group :default` configuration is unnecessary
as the default group has already initialized all fields and belongs to
associations for itself.

**Fields**

Just like in the list view, all fields are visible by default. If you specifically
declare fields, only defined fields will be visible and they will be presented
in the order defined. Thus both examples would render a form with
only one group (labeled "Default group") that would contain only one
element (labeled "Title").

In the list view label is the text displayed in the field's column header, but
in the edit views label literally means the html label element associated with
field's input element.

Naturally edit views' fields also have the visible option along with
hide and show accessors as the list view has.

**Fields - rendering**

The edit view's fields are rendered using partials. Each field type has its own
partial per default, but that can be overridden:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :name do
            partial "my_awesome_partial"
          end
        end
      end
    end

The partial should be placed in your applications template folder, such as
`app/views/rails_admin/main/_my_awesome_partial.html.erb`.

One can also completely override the rendering logic:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :name do
            render do
              bindings[:view].render :partial => partial.to_s, :locals => {:field => self}
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

That example is just the default rendering method, but it shows you that you
have access to the current template's scope with bindings[:view]. There's also
bindings[:object] available, which is the database record being edited.
Bindings concept was introduced earlier in this document and the
functionality is the same.

**Fields - overriding field type**

If you'd like to override the type of the field that gets instantiated, the
field method provides second parameter which is field type as a symbol. For
instance, if we have a column that's a text column in the database, but we'd
like to have it as a string type we could accomplish that like this:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :description, :string do
             # configuration here
          end
        end
      end
    end

If no configuration needs to take place the configuration block could have been
left out:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :description, :string
        end
      end
    end

A word of warning, if you make field declarations for the same field a number
of times with a type defining second argument in place, the type definition
will ditch the old field configuration and load a new field instance in place.

**Fields - Available field types**

RailsAdmin ships with the following field types:

* belongs_to_association
* boolean
* date
* datetime
* decimal
* file_upload _does not initialize automatically_
* paperclip_file _initializes automatically if Paperclip is present_
* float
* has_and_belongs_to_many_association
* has_many_association
* has_one_association
* integer
* password _initializes if string type column's name is password_
* string
* text
* time
* timestamp
* virtual _useful for displaying data that is calculated a runtime
(for example a method call on model instance)_

**Fields - Creating a custom field type**

If you have a reusable field you can define a custom class extending
`RailsAdmin::Config::Fields::Base` and register it for RailsAdmin:

    RailsAdmin::Config::Fields::Types::register(:my_awesome_type, MyAwesomeFieldClass)

Then you can use your custom class in a field:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :name, :my_awesome_type do
             # configuration here
          end
        end
      end
    end

**Fields - Creating a custom field factory**

Type guessing can be overridden by registering a custom field "factory", but
for now you need to study `lib/rails_admin/config/fields/factories/*` for
examples if you want to use that mechanism.

**Fields - Overriding field help texts**

Every field is accompanied by a hint/text help based on model's validations.
Everything can be overridden with `help`:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        edit do
          field :name
          field :email do
            help 'Required - popular webmail addresses not allowed'
          end
        end
      end
    end

**Fields - CKEditor integration**

CKEditor can be enabled on fields of type text:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model MyModel do
        edit do
          field :description, :text do
            ckeditor true
          end
        end
      end
    end

In this example we configured a field named description to instantiate as a
text field and set ckeditor option to true. If the database column is a text
field, explicitly setting the type as the second argument is not
necessary.

### Mass Assignment Operations ###

* Mass assign for every model configuration
* Mass assign for every section (create, list, navigation and update)
* Mass assign by field type

**Mass assign for every model configuration**

Mass assignment operations are used to pass in configuration blocks for
multiple targets at once. For instance, the code below configures every models'
every field with an uppercased label in the list view.

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.models do
        list do
          fields do
            label do
              label.upcase # in this context label refers to default label method
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

**Mass assign for every section (create, list, navigation and update)**

If one would like to assign that same behavior for all the different views in
RailsAdmin (create, list, navigation and update) one could pass the label
definition one level higher:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.models do
        fields do
          label do
            label.upcase
          end
        end
      end
    end

As the navigation section does not define the `fields` method this
configuration is only effective for create, list and update views.

Naturally this also works for a single model configuration:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.model Team do
        fields do
          label do
            label.upcase
          end
        end
      end
    end

**Mass assign by field type**

One can also assign configurations for all fields by type. For instance
modifying the date presentation of all datetime fields in all sections can be
accomplished like this:

    RailsAdmin.config do |config|
      config.models do
        fields_of_type :datetime do
          strftime_format "%Y-%m-%d"
        end
      end
    end

Authorization
-------------

Authorization can be added using the `authorize_with` method. If you pass a block
it will be triggered through a before filter on every action in Rails Admin.

    RailsAdmin.authorize_with do
      redirect_to root_path unless warden.user.is_admin?
    end

To use an authorization adapter, pass the name of the adapter. For example, to use
with [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan), pass it like this.

    RailsAdmin.authorize_with :cancan

See the [wiki](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki) for more on authorization.

Submitting an Issue
-------------------
We use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues) to track bugs and
features. Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already
been submitted. You can indicate support for an existing issue by voting it up. When submitting a
bug report, please include a [Gist](http://gist.github.com/) that includes a stack trace and any
details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and
operating system. Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Implement your feature or bug fix.  *NOTE* - there's a small test app located in the spec/dummy_app directory that you can use to experiment with rails_admin.
4. Add documentation for your feature or bug fix.
5. Run `bundle exec rake doc:yard`. If your changes are not 100% documented, go back to step 4.
6. Add specs for your feature or bug fix.
7. Run `bundle exec rake spec`. If your changes are not 100% covered, go back to step 6.
8. Commit and push your changes.

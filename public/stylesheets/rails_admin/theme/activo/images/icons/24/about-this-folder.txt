The icons listed here belong to the "Fugue Icons" library available at "http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com".

To add a new icon, enlarge the icon canvas to 24x24 pixels.
Give it the name 'action-hover.png', where 'action' is the name of the action related to the button.

To create an icon 'action.png' using an icon 'action-hover.png' do the following steps:
- Transparency 40%
- Saturation -30 (in a range between -100 and 100)
- Brightness +30 (in a range between -100 and 100)
- Yellow channel -20 (color_balance tool, in a range between -100 and 100).

Gimp was used to create this.
